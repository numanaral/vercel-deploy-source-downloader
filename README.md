# Download Vercel Source

A CLI tool to download source code from Vercel deployments. Interactive setup, automatic project/team detection, smart caching, progress tracking, and resume support.

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numanaral/vercel-deploy-source-downloader/main/assets/demo.gif)

## Quick Start

Just run the script — it walks you through everything interactively:

```bash
npx vercel-deploy-source-downloader
```

Or pass everything directly:

```bash
npx vercel-deploy-source-downloader <token> --deployment aBcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyZa
```

For detailed configuration and advanced usage, see [Documentation](#documentation).

## Getting Your Vercel Token

Create or find your token at [vercel.com/account/tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens). The token needs access to the deployments you want to download.

If you add `VERCEL_TOKEN` to a `.env` file, the interactive setup will pre-fill it so you don't have to paste it every time.

## Finding Your Deployment ID

Copy the ID from your Vercel dashboard URL:

```
https://vercel.com/your-scope/your-project/aBcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyZa/source
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                           Copy this part
```

Works with or without the `dpl_` prefix. Project and team are auto-detected.

## Install

```bash
# No install needed
npx vercel-deploy-source-downloader

# Or install globally
npm install -g vercel-deploy-source-downloader
```

## Output

```
out/dpl_aBcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyZa/
├── source/          # Downloaded source files
└── download-log.txt # Full operation log
```

Re-running the same deployment prompts to resume or start fresh.

### Example

```
📦 Deployment ID:  dpl_aBcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyZa
