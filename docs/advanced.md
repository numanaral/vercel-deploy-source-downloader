# Advanced Usage

## Output Structure

Files are organized into a deployment-specific folder:

```
out/{deployment-id}/
├── source/          # Downloaded source files
└── download-log.txt # Full operation log
```

Each deployment gets its own folder, so downloading multiple deployments won't overwrite each other.

## What Gets Downloaded

The tool downloads **source code** from your Vercel deployment:

- Source files (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, etc.)
- Configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.)
- Static assets
- Database schemas

Lambda functions and build outputs are skipped automatically.

## Re-runs and Resume

If a previous download exists for the same deployment, the tool shows how many files are already present and asks what to do.

When there are **no previous failures**:

```
📂 Previous download detected for this deployment.
   178 file(s) already downloaded.

   Enter to continue where you left off, or 'n' to re-download from scratch.

   Continue? (Y/n):
```

- **Enter** or **Y** — continue where you left off (already downloaded files are skipped)
- **n** — clear the folder and re-download from scratch

When there **are previous failures** (detected from the log file):

```
📂 Previous download detected for this deployment.
   178 file(s) already downloaded.
   2 file(s) failed in previous run.

   Y = resume (skip existing, download remaining)
   n = re-download everything from scratch
   r = retry failed only

   Choice (Y/n/r):
```

- **Enter** or **Y** — resume (skip existing, download remaining)
- **n** — clear the folder and re-download everything from scratch
- **r** — only re-download the files that failed previously

## Retrying Failed Downloads

If any files fail to download, the tool prompts you to retry immediately:

```
❌ Failed downloads: 1
   .env.example

   1 file(s) failed. Retry now? (Y/n):
```

- **Enter** or **Y** — retry the failed files right away
- **n** — skip retry; the tool prints a command you can run later:

```
   To retry later: npx tsx src/vercel-deploy-source-downloader.ts --deployment <id> --retry-failed
```

The `--retry-failed` flag reads the previous `download-log.txt`, finds which files failed, and only re-downloads those — skipping everything else.

## Verbose Mode

Use `--verbose` to see detailed output in the console:

- Per-file download/skip status
- Full file structure tree
- Skipped files list

Without `--verbose`, the console shows a spinner with download/skip counts and a summary. The log file always contains full details.

## Excluding Paths

Use `--exclude` to skip one or more paths when downloading source files. Paths are matched exactly or by prefix, and can be provided as a comma-separated list.

```bash
npx vercel-deploy-source-downloader <token> --deployment <id> --exclude .npm-cache,dist
```

This is useful when you want to avoid downloading caches or generated folders from the deployment source tree.
